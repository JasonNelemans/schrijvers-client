## Goals for this project

The goal of this project was to build and expand upon the technologies I've learned during my bootcamp, by combining the things I am interested in: web development and writing.  
The app is still a work in progress, but the horizons are clear and so is the way forward.   
 
 * practice full-stack development.  
 * Apply what I have learned and then some.  
 * Showcase approach of development by using wireframes and user stories.  
 * Practice disciplined [git usage](#Git-workflow).  
 * Open up the platform to my friends.
